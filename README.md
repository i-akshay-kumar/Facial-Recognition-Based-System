# Facial-Recognition-Based-System
Face recognition is one of the few biometric methods that includes the merits of both accuracy and low intrusiveness. In this project, the face of an individual is used for the purpose of marking attendance automatically.  Face detection is used to locate the position of the face region and face recognition is used for marking the understudyâ€™s attendance. The database of all the students in the class is stored and when the face of the individual student matches with one of the faces stored in the database then the attendance is recorded. This project introduces an involuntary attendance marking system, devoid of any kind of interference with the normal teaching procedure. The system can be also implemented during exam sessions or in other teaching activities where attendance is highly essential.
